# keyframed-videos

**keyframed-videos** is a tool for generating animations based on gradients extracted from video frames. This tool processes video frames, applies color-based pixel analysis, and generates an HTML animation with CSS and keyframes. The animation mimics the color transitions present in the video, using linear gradients for each frame.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js.
- **FFmpeg**: FFmpeg is used to extract frames from the video.
- **Sharp**: Used for processing image buffers in each frame.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avivkeller/keyframed-videos.git
   cd keyframed-videos
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Make sure you have FFmpeg installed and accessible in your PATH. If not, follow the installation guide at: [FFmpeg Installation](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. Place your MP4 video file in the project directory (or modify the `videoPath` variable in the code to point to your video file).
2. Ensure that you have the `template.html` file in the `min` folder (as expected by the script).

3. Run the script to generate the CSS animation:

   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

   - The script will process the video, extract frames, generate gradients, and create a CSS animation based on the videoâ€™s color data.
   - The generated HTML will be output to the console, with the necessary CSS for the animation.

## Customization

- You can adjust the number of concurrent processes for frame processing by changing the `maxConcurrentProcesses` constant in the code.
- Modify the `videoPath` variable to specify a custom video file.
- Adjust the `tempDir` constant to change where the frames are stored temporarily.
